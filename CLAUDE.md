# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A daily literary recommendation app inspired by Ray Bradbury's quote: "You must read one poem, one short story, and one essay every night for 1,000 nights." The app provides personalized daily recommendations across three categories, learns from user ratings, and builds reading habits through an intelligent recommendation system.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run the Flask development server
python run.py

# Seed the database with curated literary content
python scripts/seed_content.py

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Architecture Overview

### Embedding-Based Recommendation System (NEW!)
- **Technology:** Google Gemini API (gemini-embedding-001) with 3072-dimensional vectors
- **Architecture:** Hybrid approach combining embedding similarity + LLM refinement
- **Process Flow:** 
  1. Generate embeddings for all works and user preferences
  2. Use cosine similarity to find top 50 candidates (fast, cheap)
  3. LLM scores top candidates for final ranking (accurate, expensive)
  4. Populate UserWorkPool with confidence scores
- **Benefits:** Cost-effective, scalable, and intelligently matches user preferences to content

### UserWorkPool System (ENHANCED)
- **Purpose:** Pre-generates and caches recommendations using embedding + LLM hybrid scoring
- **Logic:** Embedding similarity finds candidates â†’ LLM refines â†’ stores with confidence scores
- **Daily Selection:** Pick highest confidence works not recently recommended
- **Learning:** Good ratings boost similar works, bad ratings lower confidence scores

### Core Data Model Flow (Simplified Architecture)

The recommendation system works through individual WorkRecommendation records:

1. **User** â†’ **UserPreference**: Captures reading preferences during onboarding with natural language summaries
2. **Work** â†’ **UserWorkPool**: Algorithm adds works to user's personalized pool with confidence scores
3. **UserWorkPool** â†’ **WorkRecommendation**: Daily algorithm selects from pool to create individual recommendations
4. **Individual recommendations**: Each work type (poem/story/essay) is independent - no grouping required

### Key Model Relationships

- `WorkRecommendation` includes `work_type` field ('poem', 'short_story', 'essay') for independent tracking
- `UserWorkPool` tracks recommendation history via `times_recommended`, `last_recommended_at`, and `status` (available/recommended/exhausted)
- `User.preference_summary` stores LLM-friendly natural language version of all preferences
- All datetime fields use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for UTC timestamps

### Recommendation Algorithm Design

```python
def generate_daily_recommendation(user_id, work_type, date):
    # 1. Check if recommendation already exists for date and work_type
    # 2. Get user's available work pool for specific type (status='available') 
    # 3. Select highest confidence work not recently recommended
    # 4. Create individual WorkRecommendation record with work_type
    # 5. Update UserWorkPool status to 'recommended'
    
# Generate all three independently
recommendations = {
    'poem': generate_daily_recommendation(user_id, 'poem', date),
    'story': generate_daily_recommendation(user_id, 'short_story', date),
    'essay': generate_daily_recommendation(user_id, 'essay', date)
}
```

### Learning System
- **Good ratings (4-5 stars):** Add similar works, boost confidence of related items
- **Bad ratings (1-2 stars):** Remove similar works, lower confidence scores  
- **Preference changes:** Regenerate relevant pool sections
- **Pool refresh:** Generate new works every few weeks

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Flask + SQLAlchemy
- **Database:** SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)  
- **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS via CDN, minimal JavaScript
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login
- **Planned AI Integration:** LLM API (OpenAI/Anthropic) for generating recommendation pools
- **Content Sources:** Public domain works (Project Gutenberg, Poetry Foundation)

## Code Style & Preferences

### Python/Flask Conventions:
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for all database operations
- Flask-Login for authentication
- Blueprint structure for routes
- Environment-based configuration (config.py)
- Clear model relationships with proper foreign keys

### Frontend Approach:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (already implemented)
- **Minimal JavaScript** - progressive enhancement
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
